# Q1. Create a Python program to sort the given list of tuples based on the integer value using a lambda function.

# List of tuples
players = [('Sachin Tendulkar', 34357), ('Ricky Ponting', 27483), 
           ('Jack Kallis', 25534), ('Virat Kohli', 24936)]

# Sort the list based on the integer value (second element)
sorted_players = sorted(players, key=lambda x: x[1])

# Output the sorted list
print(sorted_players)




# Q2. Write a Python Program to find the squares of all the numbers in the given list of integers using lambda and map functions.

# Given list of integers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Use map and lambda to find the squares of all numbers
squares = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))

# Output the result
print(squares)


# Q3. Write a Python program to convert the given list of integers into a tuple of strings. Use map and lambda functions.

# Given list of integers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Use map and lambda to convert integers to strings
str_numbers = tuple(map(lambda x: str(x), numbers))

# Output the result
print(str_numbers)



# Q4. Write a Python program using the reduce function to compute the product of a list containing numbers from 1 to 25.

from functools import reduce

# List of numbers from 1 to 25
numbers = list(range(1, 26))

# Use reduce and lambda to compute the product of the list
product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, numbers)

# Output the result
print(product)





# Q5. Write a Python program to filter the numbers in a given list that are divisible by 2 and 3 using the filter function.

# Given list of numbers
numbers = [2, 3, 6, 9, 27, 60, 90, 120, 55, 46]

# Use filter and lambda to find numbers divisible by both 2 and 3
divisible_by_2_and_3 = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0 and x % 3 == 0, numbers))

# Output the result
print(divisible_by_2_and_3)


# Q6. Write a Python program to find palindromes in the given list of strings using lambda and filter function.

# Given list of strings
words = ['python', 'php', 'aba', 'radar', 'level']

# Use filter and lambda to find palindromes
palindromes = list(filter(lambda x: x == x[::-1], words))

# Output the result
print(palindromes)
